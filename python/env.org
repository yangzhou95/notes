* jupyter-lab cannot find my env

* solutions
  - Assuming your conda-env is named cenv, it is as simple as :
  - conda activate cenv
  - (cenv)$ conda install ipykernel
  - (cenv)$ ipython kernel install --user --name=<any_name_for_kernel>
  - (cenv($ conda deactivate
  - If you restart your jupyter notebook/lab you will be able to see the new kernel available.
  - PS: If you are using virtualenv etc. the above steps hold good.
